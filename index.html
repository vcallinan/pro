  <p><strong>PRO (The Producers and Remixers Organization)</strong> is a student-run organization at the University of California, San Diego, that is dedicated to teaching the art of electronic music production. Our mission is to bring worthwhile music production knowledge to the San Diego electronic music scene, as well as build a community of musicians that can work and grow together.</p>
  <p>This is one of the many ways <strong>PRO</strong> communicates with its members. You can find info regarding our meeting times, event info, and other useful tidbits of information that we feel are important for you to know as an aspiring music producer.</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to stay in the loop regarding our general meetings, join the <a href="https://mailman.ucsd.edu/mailman/listinfo/pro-l">mailing list</a>! This is our definitive way of posting meeting times, locations, and any last minute changes.</p>

<p>Lastly, check out our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/408325669297089/">Facebook group</a> for more info on how to get involved in our community. Anyone is welcome to join the group, even non-UCSD folks! We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
