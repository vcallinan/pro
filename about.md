Our mission is to bring worthwhile music production knowledge to the San Diego electronic music scene, as well as build a community of musicians that can work and grow together.  We welcome people from all backgrounds and pursuits, including singers, songwriters, classical musicians, and everything in-between.  Ableton Live is our software of choice, however the information we share is universal amongst all DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations).  Come by our meetings and join the crew!
